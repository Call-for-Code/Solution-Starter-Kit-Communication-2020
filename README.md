## Overview

### What's the problem?
In times of crisis, communications systems are often overwhelmed with people trying to find basic information about testing, symptoms, community response, and other resources. When communication lines get clogged, people who need real help can't get through. Chatbots help respond to tens, even hundreds, of thousands of messages a day.

### How can technology help ?

Whether via text, phone, websites, or communication apps, conversing with chatbots and other AI-enabled resources can play a critical role in helping communities quickly understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues.

IBM Watson Assistant service helps you build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel. Creating a chatbot using Watson Assistant can help address the issues that our users face while trying to gather accurate, relevant information. Whether you're trying to learn the latest news about Covid-19 or learn where there's testing in your area, a chatbot can play a major role in helping communities quickly understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues.

## The idea

COVID-19 has citizens looking for answers about symptoms and testing sites as well as current status of schools, transportation, and other public services. Using Watson Assistant, this Call for Code Starter Kit has designed a virtual assistant pre-loaded to understand and respond to common questions about COVID-19, scan COVID-19 news articles using Watson Discovery and respond to COVID statistics inquires with data from trusted sources.

With this Watson Assistant powered Crisis Communications Starter Kit you can integrate a chatbot into your Call for Code solution in an IBM Cloud hosted web server, using a Slack integration or via a Node-RED Dashboard. 

It can:
- Respond by sharing consistent, accurate COVID-19 information
- Help citizens quickly and easily access the latest information through their channel of choice – voice, text or collaborative tool
- Free valuable resources by automating answers to common COVID-19 questions
- Dynamically update information with the latest developments and recommendations

The challenge for you is to build out from this framework to create a more complete solution.

### Connect your chatbot to data sources via a webhook

Now that you’ve created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. With Watson Assistant, you need to do this via a webhook.

A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response.

[Follow these instructions for setting up webhook](./starter-kit/webhook/README.md) with the Watson Assistant chatbot you just provisioned.

### Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack

Now that you have a functioning Watson Assistant, let's deploy it to Slack. Slack is a cloud-based messaging application that helps people collaborate with one another. After you configure a dialog skill and add it to an assistant, you can integrate the assistant with Slack.

When integrated, depending on the events that you configure the assistant to support, your assistant can respond to questions that are asked in direct messages or in channels where the assistant is directly mentioned.

[Read these instructions](/starter-kit/slack/README.md) to learn how to integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack.

### Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Node-RED

Want to create a voice-enabled chatbot? This tutorial teaches you how to [create a voice enabled chatbot using Node-RED](./starter-kit/node-red/README.md) and the Watson Assistant, Watson Speech to Text, and Watson Text to Speech nodes.

### Embed your COVID-19 chatbot on a Node.js website

Finally, you can embed your COVID-19 crisis communication chatbot on a Node.js website.

- Follow the [COVID-Simple installation instructions](./starter-kit/covid-simple/README.md)
