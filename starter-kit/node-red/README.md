- Speech To Text: Convert audio containing speech to text
- Text To Speech: Convert text to audio speech
- Tone Analyzer: Discover, understand, and revise the language tones in text
- Visual Recognition: Analyze visual appearance of images to understand their contents

### Import and deploy the COVID-19 crisis communication chatbot example

Now that you have installed the Node-RED dependencies, Watson nodes are available to integrate Watson AI services. Let's build a voice enabled chatbot example that uses Watson Assistant, Watson Speech to Text and Watson Text to Speech.

Import this [flow](/starter-kit/node-red/flows/Node-RED-Voice-Enabled-Chatbot.json) and **Deploy** the flow.

![Node-RED flow](./images/Node-RED-COVIDChatBot-flow.png)

### Create Watson Services on IBM Cloud

Before the flow will execute successfully, you must configure the Watson Assistant and Watson Speech nodes with new service instances and API Keys.

#### Create a Watson Assistant instance

1. If you haven't already, create a [Watson Assistant service instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).

 ![IBM Cloud Catalog Watson Assistant](/starter-kit/assistant/WA-Photo1.png)

1. Follow these [instructions](/README.md) to provision a Watson Assistant chatbot for COVID-19

#### Create a Watson Speech to Text service instance

1. Create a [Watson Speech to Text Service instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) instance from the IBM Cloud Catalog. Click **Create**.

 ![Create Watson Speech to Text service instance](./images/Create-Watson-STT.png)

 The Node-RED Watson Speech to Text node will need the `apikey` credentials for this new instance.
2. Once the Watson Speech to Text service has been created, click **Service credentials** (1).
3. Click the **View credentials** (2) twistie.
4. Copy the **apikey** (3) for use in the next section

![Watson STT credentials](./images/Watson-STT-apikey.png)

### Parse intents and invoke API calls

Watson Assistant returns the intents related to your questions.

- The `Switch` node routes two intents to an `http request` node to query an external data source for current COVID statistics.
- A `Function` node adds up the summary statistics and builds a sentence to be spoken.

### Deploy the Node-RED flows

- Click on the Red **Deploy** button,

### Talk to your COVID-19 crisis chatbot

To talk to your chatbot, click on the **microphone** input tab and ask a question about COVID.

![Node-RED flow](./images/Talk2COVIDChatBot.png)

### Build a Node-RED COVID Statistics Dashboard

**Bonus**: This flow includes a Node-RED Dashboard with several gauges to display COVID-19 statistics.

![Node-RED COVID Data Dashboard](./images/Node-RED-COVID-Dashboard.png)

- Every hour the Node-RED flow will call the [covid19api](https://api.covid19api.com/summary) summary API and collect dynamic COVID-19 infection statistics
- The country data is aggregated and then the gauges are updated

### Learn more about the Dashboard code

The following Node-RED flow is included in this tutorial.

![Node-RED COVID Data Dashboard](./images/Node-RED-COVID-Dashboard-flow.png)

The `http request` node is using the [public Covid-19 API](https://api.covid19api.com/summary) to retrieve the daily information for all countries with infections. 

Here's the sample JSON object from the summary API:

```json
{"Country":"US","Slug":"us","NewConfirmed":18058,"TotalConfirmed":83836,"NewDeaths":267,"TotalDeaths":1209,"NewRecovered":320,"TotalRecovered":681},
```

Each `function` node then aggregates the Total Confirmed Cases, Total Fatalities, Total Recovered, and Total Countries and sends the results to the corresponding `gauge` node.

This is the code in the `function` node:

```javascript
let totalConfirmedCase = 0;

msg.payload.Countries.map(function(line){
    totalConfirmedCase += line.TotalConfirmed;
});

msg.payload = totalConfirmedCase;

return msg;
```

You can expand the above dashboard to include daily new infections from [covid19api](https://api.covid19api.com/summary) data, charts, tables, and the chatbot UI.

## Build a Call for Code Crisis Communications solution!

Now that you have completed this tutorial, you are ready to modify these example flows and Node-RED Dashboard to build a [Call for Code COVID Crisis Communications](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/getstarted/covid-19/) solution.
