Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods.

            "Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are adapting in-person lessons to online or virtual learning. Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible. Have consistent bedtimes and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday. Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity. Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person. Look for ways to make learning fun. Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience. Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events."

Advise older children to hang out in a small group and to meet up outside rather than inside. It’s easier to keep and maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks. If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (i.e. social distancing). Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors , such as cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk. This includes spring break and other group travel. Parents should help their older children revise spring break plans that included non-essential travel to crowded areas. Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may show only mild symptoms.

CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including: Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately . Emergency warning signs include*: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion or inability to arouse Bluish lips or face *This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Clean hands regularly by handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. Clean the sick room and bathroom , as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person. Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks."
